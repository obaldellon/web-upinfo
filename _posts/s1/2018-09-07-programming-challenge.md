### Grading ###

 <!--- - **Concours UCAnCODE** (40%): you will participate to a local programming contest. Your grade will depend on your rank in the contest. -->
- **Homework with Sphere Engine** (40%): there will be two problems sets over the course of the semester. Pair work is allowed.
  - [STAR](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=d82S0aO7SN)
- **Final Exam** (60%): there will be one final exam (3 hours), likely on a computer, where you will be asked to solve two problems. 
    <!-- - You will be asked to solve in writing one of two problems :  The first one is graded out of 15 and the second one out of 20. -->

First, you must masterize the [tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url ucancode/2019-07-22-tutoriel %}).

##### Instructions for submitting your homework
- Fill the problem form with your student email adresse.
- For pair work, give your two email adresses as a comment in the file header.

Beware that penalties will be given if you do not follow the above instructions.
