Classical networking paradigms and architectures are becoming outdated very quickly because of the evolution of users’ habits and technological development. Thus, this course aims to bridge the gap between the basics presented in a classical " Introduction to Networking " course and the novel technologies and protocols deployed in Internet nowadays.

A previous background on networking basics is expected to follow the course. Students not fulfilling such requirement are strongly recommended to follow the course “Computer Networks” in the 1st semester.
